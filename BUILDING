You must build a gcc cross compiler in order to build this project.  You can
basicaly follow the directions at osdev.org and get up to speed.

Once your cross compiler is built, you need to export 2 varibles:

export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/your/cross/compiler/bin
export CROSS_COMPILE=target-exectuable-format-with-trailing-hyphen-

For example, my executable format is i586-elf and my cross compiler toolchain
is located at /usr/share/cross/bin, so these are my environment settings:

export PATH=$PATH:/usr/share/cross/bin
export CROSS_COMPILE=i586-elf-

DON'T FORGET THE TRAILING HYPHEN (dash)!!!  The makefiles aren't very robust,
so the hyphen is needed.

You'll also want to grab the latest copy of the Flat Assembler, FASM, from
http://flatassembler.net and either install it to one of the system bin paths
or its path to your 'export PATH' line above.

Another thing you'll need is either Bochs or Qemu.  I had this working in Bochs
at one point, but as of right now this is broken.  The easiest way to run the
kernel (if you want to call it that), is by using Qemu.  From the project root,
simply type the following, assuming everything built correctly:

qemu -kernel src/kernel.bin

You should see a "passed" message in green text.  If not, something went wrong.
